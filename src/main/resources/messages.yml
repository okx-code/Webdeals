# Please read the following page on how to use formatting in strings (ie %s)
# https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html
# Note that whenever %s is used, it is optional.

# See the following for information on how to change 'money_format'
# https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/text/DecimalFormat.html
# If you just want to change the currency, just change the $ character to whichever you like, ie £
# It is very important to change the currency to what you are using if you are not using dollars!
# Otherwise people will get confused. Because if the main currency in your store is £
# and you have the money format using $, the plugin will say a coupon's worth $10 but it will actually be worth £10!

# For colour formatting, see the following
